SKELETON:

Ever since I was a child, I was plagued with the same 'stress pattern': bad situation -> emotions -> trains of thoughts "I would show them" -> spiral on forever

Starts with me being angry for no reason - or for many benign reasons - and not being able to control it.

First attempt at therapy - huge progress, ability to defuse emotions. I couldn't understand them yet back then, and wasn't able to fully control.

All the time, I cannot really tell what 'stress' is. I know I'm under its influence, but I really feel the same.

Research - HPA axis (hipocampus-pituitary gland-amygdala) activations, amygdala's lateral nucleus. Further research leads to basal gangla and how it projects onto the amygdala.
Conections to hipocampus-pituitary gland not traced...

Tough time at work - HPA goes haywire.

Second attempt at therapy, and lots of self-inspired excercises. 
Focus on detecting the change in emotions, to catch the early stages of anger. 
Developing a toolkit for handling stressful situations - stepping back, then relaxing.
Relaxation - breating.
Next, using breath 'during' difficult moments to train the lateral nucleus and teach it that they are actually ok. Helped me overcome the 'hunger anger' and a few others.

February.
I notice that I'm relaxed - I think for the very first time. It shows through lack of 'trains of thoughts'.
I'm noticing how physical sensations (hunger, fatigue, thirst) affect the emotions, making me more prone to flips. I can recover from those super fast now. But more importantly, I rarely give in - they are next to me, but no longer drag me into the spiral.

What's next?

KEY TAKE AWAY:
- I beat the anger, and so can you
- techniques 
- I never knew what it means to be 'relaxed' - now I can tell you
- I'm like you, I went through it - here's how

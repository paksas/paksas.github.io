Cure - learn yourself, learn to anticipate emotional changes, learn how youy physiology affects your emotions. Build a mechanism for handling those cases.


## Emotions

Have you ever experienced emotions overwhelming you?
It may have happened at home, or at work.

In that moment, you felt right and justified. But when the moment passed, you had to face the consequence
of your actions.

## What affects them

I spent the last 6 years investigating this phenomenon. It has a lot to do with the Amygdalas, fear responses and how our brain interprets non-verbal communication.

I was surprised to find out how many things affected my emotional state:
* physical sensations, like hunger, thirst, pain and fatigue
* being focused on something
* prior emotional state

# How to control them

I worked with a number of specialists, including psychotherapists and meditation gurus, to build a general mechanism that would allow me to handle everyday situations without emotions.

It consists of:
* ability to observe one's physical and emotional state
* ability to understand and tend to one's physical and emotional needs
* ability to give assertive responses
* ability to expand your comfort zone

## Observation

Based on these observations, you may decide to politely excuse yourself out of a conversation, because you noticed you're tired or too focused on something else.

You may also decide to drink or eat something when you notice that you cannot properly focus.
This mechanism informs you about the needs that you have.

## Needs

I learned that when you crave something, your focus drifts from other topics.
It's an obvious conclusion when you think about hunger or thirst. However, I found it to be true also when it comes to the need of attention, rest, human contact, feeling of being understood.

## Assertiveness

Very often in life an uncomfortable situation appears out of nowhere and traps us. In such cases I felt compelled to follow through, because otherwise I would hurt someone or another.

Learning that that's not the case, and how to politely excuse ourselves, allows us to avoid panic when such situations arise.

## Comfort zone

The three components listed so far are a prerequisite that allows to handle emotions. They don't allow to curb them however. 
If you keep using them, you will always feel that same pang of stress when certain situations arise.

In order to overcome that, you need to teach your Amygdala that they aren't scary and don't lead to a disaster. That is what I call 'expanding your comfort zone'.

Thanks to this final component, you will only ever feel stress with brand new situations, and the feeling will be less and less frequent.
That will allow you to start exploring all different options in life.

# Credits

I need to give credit where credit is due.

I would like to thank my wife Dancia for all the love and support, without which nothing would work out.

I would also like to thank  dr. Anna Mochnaczewska, my psychotherapist, who taught me so many techniques and helped me understand myself.

Thank you!

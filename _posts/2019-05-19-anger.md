# Emotions

Have you ever experienced emotions overwhelming you?

I did. 

Sometimes it felt like someone was attacking me, and I needed to defend myself.
Sometimes, it felt like I was being misuderstood, and I just wanted to clarify things.

In the spur of the moment, I felt my actions were right and justified.
When the moment passed, I had to face their consequence.

Every single time, it left me feeling depressed and out of control.

# What affects them

I spent the last 6 years investigating this phenomenon. It has a lot to do with the Amygdalas, fear responses[1] and how our brain interprets non-verbal communication[4].

I was surprised to find out how many things affected my emotional state:
* physical sensations, like hunger, thirst, pain and fatigue
* being focused on something
* prior emotional state

# How to control them

I worked with a number of specialists, including psychotherapists and meditation gurus, to build a general mechanism that would allow me to handle everyday situations without emotions.

It consists of:
* ability to observe one's physical and emotional state
* ability to understand and tend to one's physical and emotional needs
* ability to give assertive responses
* ability to expand your comfort zone

## Observe my needs

I learned that putting choirs and responsibilities over my physical and mental needs didn't work too well in the long run.

So I learned how to notice and understand how I feel and what my body needs.

I may decide to politely excuse myself out of a conversation, because I noticed that I was tired or too focused on something else.
I may decide to drink or eat something when I noticed that I couldn't focus my attention on a task at hand.

The technique I used to develop this ability was Mindfulness [2].
Initially, I enrolled in a full program. After a few weeks however, I noticed that I only need to repeat a 3 minute long breathing exercise, and then focus on how my body feels (hunger, thirst, fatigue etc)
.

## Attend to them

I learned that when I crave something, my focus drifts from other topics.
It's an obvious conclusion when you think about hunger or thirst. 

However, I found it to be true also when it comes to the need for attention, rest, human contact, feeling of being understood.

Somewhere during my growing up, I learned to supress those feelings. I perceived them as being demeaning. So I re-learned to attend to them as soon as they arise.
The happier I am in my body, the happier I am being around others and facing challanges.

The prerequisite to this step was the ability to observe and understand my own body. Then, I worked with a psychotherapist of removing mental blockades around fulfilling my needs. We used Behavioral Cognitive Therapy, and the process took about 3 years.

## Be assertive about them

I very seldom had control over when an uncomfortable situation would befall me.

In such cases I felt compelled to follow through, because otherwise I thought I would hurt someone else's feelings. But I wasn't putting my heart in what I was doing, and the effect was usually even more damaging.

I worked with a psychotherapist to learn how to be polite but assertive.
A prerequisite to that was also the ability to observe my needs and heed to them.

## Train your Amygdalas

The three techniques listed so far were a prerequisite that allowed me to control my emotions.
But every situation that had yielded them, was yielding them still.

So I learned how to teach my Amygdalas [3] that they aren't scary and don't lead to a disaster.
It felt like I was broadening my comfort zone. Situations I used to fear became a pleasant experience.

To give a concrete example, chatting to complete strangers used to terrify me. Now I'm actively seeking to make new friendships.

The training also taught me to keep looking for things that scare me - and dare to try them.

The technique I used was a combination of breath control meditation I learned while studying Mindfulness [2], and a simple visualization technique.

Whenever an unpleasant event occured, I took a few deep breaths with my eyes closed, and I repeated a positive affirmation phrase (ie. "it's ok, it's not scary"). 
If the situation was really overwhelming, I seeked a safe place and launched into the meditation there. 
Then I actively seeked to repeat that experience and kept meditating through it, until I no longer responded emotionally.

...I guess they are right when they say "get back on the horse that bucked you".

# Credits

I wouldn't have accomplished all of this alone.

I would like to thank my wife Dancia for all the love and support, without which nothing would work out.

I would also like to thank  dr. Anna Mochnaczewska, my psychotherapist, who taught me so many techniques and helped me understand myself.

Thank you!

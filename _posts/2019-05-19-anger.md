## Have you ever lost control...
Were you ever brainstorming an idea with your colleagues at work, but they just wouldn't want to listen? 

You were really on fire there - the ideas that came to your mind were amazing. You didn't know you have it in you.

No one else seemed to appreciate them the same way for some reason.

## ...and then felt uncomfortable afterwards?
You got back to your desk, and you felt wrong. Were you raising your voice in there? Or perhaps your phrasing was a bit too strong? Were you pushy?

## What happened?
You were rejected.

You don't take rejection too well - for many possible reasons. Bad stuff happened to you when it happened a long time ago, and your brain learned to respond to it - fight it.

You started fighting for acceptance, but in a very visceral way. Your high level problem solving part of the brain got switched off, and you were left with the lizard brain attacking everyone with a language club.

And when you finally had a chance to recover, you started remembering what happened. And the conclusion you drawn (again, on the spot) was that rejection is bad - and the prejudice deepened.

That's when the trains of thoughts begin. Ruminations on what you could have done to avoid it. 

## Stress, meditation, mindfulness...
None of the above is very revaling. There's a ton of books, videos and classes on how to calm yourself, regain control etc.
There's a whole branch of psychology called Behavioral Cognitive Therapy that is supposed to help people with such situations.

I have tried all of those. And probably you have too. They have one thing in common - they treat a single problem. 

## Where am I now
So why am I writing this? I'm not a psychologist or a meditation guru.

However:
- I don't have any trains of thoughts any more
- I can focus whenever I want, on whatever I want, for how long I want
- I can detect my mood changes before they take over and react.
- I detect them in my peers - it helps me understand what they are actually saying.
- I don't get angry.

## Observing the process

When I was in school, my mom used to tell me "be yourself". 
It's hard to "be yourself" if you don't know who you are?
Was I supposed to be Polish? Was I supposed to be a boy? Was I supposed to to be someone who likes to sleep in?

I noticed I get stressed only in social situations. I almost never got worked up while sitting alone at home. And when I did, it usually happened when I was thinking about a social situation.

I noticed that social interactions follow a very simple pattern.

Greeting -> chit chat -> communicating a problem (mutual) -> attempt at understanding (!) -> end

The end might come in two flavors:
- we give up on understanding and retract (not necessarily physically)
- we continue digging

Both may lead to a prolongued conversation, during which you may experience various physical sensations (hunger, thirst, full bladder). Funny thing is that in the heat of conversation, you will ignore them. They will however affect how your conversation proceeds.

It may also happen that the conversation opens uncomfortable mental avenues - the feeling not knowing something is the worst of them all.

## The toolkit.

As it turns out, I needed to develop a toolkit to handle various events that may happen.

### Attend to your needs
This is very literal. 

If you're hungry or thirsty, a meeting will just annoy you.
Same if you're feeling tired, and your partner wants to go out in the evening. 

It also applies to emotional needs. If something upset you, it's better to stay alone for a while and let cortizol do its thing rather than push yourself.

But in order to be able to do those things, you need the next tool.

### Be aware of your needs
The practice of mindfulness helps to start the process. It's extremely boring however. 

So instead, I simply started interrupting myself during various activities of the day and naming my state - do I feel hungry, thirsty, tired, angry, scared, bored.

It took me about a month for this to become my second nature.

### Always tell the truth
Don't hide anger under cover of hunger. Bbut be aware that hunger may lead to anger.
Call it as it is and analyze what led to a particular feeling.

This part takes a lot of practice. For me, it took more than 5 years.

### Step away (aka. assertiveness)
Sometimes you have no choice but to enter a conversation, in spite of what your body tells you.
Sometimes you will enter if happy, but things will go south later.

You can always step away. If not literally, then mentally. 

### Pause... and drink water.
At least 2 liters a day. Everything sounds like an accusation to me when I'm dehydrated. 

Remembering to drink is hard though - especially if you loose yourself in work (zone out). 
Your body will give you several warnings that vary depending on your dehydration level:
- focus drifting away - light dehydration, happens after approx. 30 mins of goign without a drink.
- train of thought - you're mildly dehydrated
- headache - you're severely dehydrated, happens to me after approx. 3 hours of going without a drink.

It's also a perfect opportunity to pause what you were doing, take a few deep breaths, and asses your physical and emotional state.

## Don't push yourself

Unfortunately developing those takes a lot of time, support of others, and above all - self motivation.

There's also another thing that allowed me to keep going. I wasn't pushing myself too far out of my comfort zone. That came later, once I had the tools, and I knew myself enough to assess what would be harmful.

## What's next?
"Project amygdala" has taken me good 7 years. I have lots of material to cover, so I'll definately write more on the topic. 
This post is a summary of the effort. If you have any questions - just shoot me an email

## Credits
I need to give credit where credit is due:
- my wife - for all the love and support, without which nothing would work out.
- dr. Anna Mochnaczewska - my psychologist, who taught me so many techniques and helped me understand myself.

Thank you!

# Emotions

Have you ever experienced overwhelming emotions in a perfectly underwhelming, everyday situation?

I did. 

Sometimes it felt like someone was attacking me, and I needed to defend myself.
Sometimes, it felt like I was being misuderstood, and I just wanted to clarify things.

In the spur of the moment, I felt my actions were right and justified.
When the moment passed, I had to face their consequence.

Every single time, it left me feeling depressed and out of control.

# What affects them

I spent the last 6 years investigating this phenomenon. It has a lot to do with the Amygdalas, fear responses[1] and how our brain interprets non-verbal communication[4].

I was surprised to find out how many things affected my emotional state:
* physical sensations, like hunger, thirst, pain and fatigue
* being focused on something
* prior emotional state

# How to control them

I worked with a number of specialists, including psychotherapists and meditation gurus, to build a general mechanism that would allow me to approach everyday situations without emotion.

It consists of:
* ability to observe one's physical and emotional state
* ability to understand and tend to one's physical and emotional needs
* ability to give assertive responses
* ability to expand your comfort zone

## Observe my needs

I learned that putting responsibilities over my physical and mental needs did more damage than good.

So I learned how to notice and understand my physical and emotional sensations.

I may decide to politely excuse myself out of a conversation, because I noticed that I was tired or too focused on something else.
I may decide to drink or eat something when I noticed that I couldn't focus my attention on a task at hand.

The technique I used to develop this ability was Mindfulness [2].
All I needed was 3 minute breathing exercise (TODO: link), followed by focusing my attention on my body and how it felt (hungry, thirsty, tired).

## Attend to them

I learned that when I crave something, my focus drifts.
It's quite obvious if you think about it. Recall what happens when you get very hungry. 

I found it to be true for other cravings too - the need for attention, rest, human contact, need to be understood.

When I was growing up, I learned to supress those needs. I had perceived them as demeaning. 
So I had to re-learn how to accept and tend to them.
The happier I am in the body I inhabit, the happier I am being around others and facing challanges.

The prerequisite to this step was the ability to observe and understand my own body. I worked with a psychotherapist of removing mental blockades that were supressing my needs. 
We used Behavioral Cognitive Therapy (TODO: link). The process took about 3 years.

## Be assertive about them

I seldom had control over when an uncomfortable situation would befall me.

In such cases I felt compelled to follow through, because otherwise I thought I would hurt someone else's feelings. But I wasn't putting my heart in what I was doing, and the effect was usually even more damaging.

I worked with a psychotherapist to learn how to be polite but assertive.
A prerequisite to that was also the ability to observe my needs and heed to them.

## Train your Amygdalas

The three techniques listed so far were a prerequisite that allowed me to control my emotions.
But every situation that had yielded them was yielding them still.

So I learned how to calm my Amygdalas[3] when I felt uncomfortable. In what one might call "stepping out of one's comfort zone". And then, what used to scare me, started exciting me.

To give a concrete example, chatting to complete strangers used to terrify me. Now I find it the most pleasant part of the day.

The technique I used was a combination of breath control meditation I learned while studying Mindfulness [2], followed by a simple visualization technique.

Whenever an unpleasant event occured, I took a few deep breaths with my eyes closed, and I repeated a positive affirmation phrase (ie. "it's ok, it's not scary"). 
If the situation was really overwhelming, I seeked a safe place and launched into the meditation there. 
Then I actively seeked to repeat that experience and kept meditating through it, until I no longer responded emotionally.

...I guess they are right when they say "get back on the horse that bucked you".

# Credits

I wouldn't have accomplished all of this alone.

I would like to thank my wife Dancia for all the love and support, without which nothing would work out.

I would also like to thank  dr. Anna Mochnaczewska, my psychotherapist, who taught me so many techniques and helped me understand myself.

Thank you!

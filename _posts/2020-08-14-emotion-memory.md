Just the other day I was watching "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine", when one of the characters seemed familiar to me - [Dr Julian Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bashir). 

As it turned out, the actor who played Dr Bashir - [Alexander Siddig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Siddig) - starred in ["The Spy"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_(TV_series)) as [Ahmed Suidani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Suidani). This dark and menacing character stands in stark contrast to the character of the always eager, friendly and unassuming Dr Bashir.

A couple episodes later, I noticed that my attitude towards Dr Bashir changed, and I no longer perceived his friend as friendly.
And then I asked myself - would that have changed had I first watched Deep Space Nine?

How and where are emotions associated with memories?
